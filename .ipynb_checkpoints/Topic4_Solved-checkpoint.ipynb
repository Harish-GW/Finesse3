If an electric field $E$ (which in general is a complex quantity) is incident on the photodiode, the generated photocurrent is proportional to $EE* \\equiv |E|^2$ (where the averaging of the optical frequency of 300 THz is implicit). This is generally a poor strategy in the context of measuring *small* signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our interferometers, we often rely on the beat between a *Local Oscilaltor* field, $E_{\\mathrm{LO}}$, and the *Signal field*, $E_{\\mathrm{sig}}$ to directly access the amplitude of an electric field (which is what encodes information about mirror motion). Conceptually, the purpose of $E_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ is to *amplify* the small signal field we wish to measure. Mathematically, the photocurrent can be expressed as:\n",

    "\n",
    "## How to model a transfer function \n",
    "Transfer functions show us how signals propagate through system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model a transfer function in Finesse there is a specfic recipe you must follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add an `fsig` command. e.g. `fsig sig1 laser amp 1 0 1`, this adds a signal to the simulation called `sig1`, it takes the `laser` and modulates the `amp` (amplitude). It does this at `1`Hz, with `0` phase offset, with an amplitude of `1`.\n",
    "1. Add a detector to demodulate this signal, e.g. `pd1 tf $fs n1`. This measures the signal we added with the `fsig` command before. `$fs` is a special variable which is always the same frequency as the `fsig` command.\n",
    "1. Scan the signal frequency we are applying, e.g. `xaxis sig1 f log 10k 1G 1000`. To generate a transfer function we have to calculate how the modulation responds at a range of frequencies. This `xaxis` command changes the frequency which we modulate the amplitude.\n",
    "1. Use `yaxis abs:deg` to get the complex valued transfer function, so we can see amplitude and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: power oscillations $\\to$ photodiode output\n",
    "In this example we compute how laser power noise affects a photodiode output. We create the power oscillations by modulating the `laser`'s amplitude using the special command `fsig`. This will modulate the amplitude at particular frequency. We then measure how this modulation propagates to a photodiode output by demodulating a photodiode output at the same frequency as the oscillation. This process calculates the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pykat code for this is:\n",

    "#### Multiple fsigs\n",
    "\n",
    "In Finesse you can use multiple `fsig` commands at once in a simulation. This is useful when you have two effects happening at once. For example, two mirrors are being moved at the same time but out of phase with each other, as one moves in one direction, the other mirror moves in the opposite direction. This signal can be described with the following two `fsig` commands:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fsig sig1 MX z 1 0 1\n",
    "fsig sig2 MY z 1 180 1\n",
